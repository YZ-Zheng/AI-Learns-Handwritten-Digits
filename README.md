# AI-Learns-Handwritten-Digits

This is the development of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to recognize handwritten digits using PyTorch. The datasets are taken from MOOC MITx - 6.86x Machine Learning with Python-From Linear Models to Deep Learning course on edX.

# Instruction

1. *conv.py* trains the model from scratch using the data in **Datasets folder** and saves it in **CNN_Model folder**.

2. *load_data.py* and *train_data.py* contain utils functions used in *conv.py*

3. *CNN_Prediction.py* takes the user drawn digits and try to recognize them using the model built in 1

You may improve the model accuracy by altering the CNN architecture in *conv.py* and retrain it, or simply run *paint.py* to see how the current model does in recognizing your handwritten digits. **Remember to maximize the Drawing Tool window to have your handwritten digits properly captured**
